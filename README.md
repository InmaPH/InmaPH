## Hello World, I am Inma! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ Focused on Power BI, data gathering methods and best practices for quantitative and qualitative analysis.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on my portfolio, so youâ€™ll notice new projects being added here regularly.

ðŸ’¡ A bit about me: I have a background in Criminology and experience as a Project Manager in Cybersecurity. Data is my true passion which is why I moved to a Portfolio Analyst position where I could put my data skills into practice. 

:dart: My goal is to find a Data Analytics or Business Intelligence role that provides opportunities for growth, where I can leverage my skills in data-driven insights while expanding my expertise toward a future as a Data Scientist.

ðŸ“§ Iâ€™m always open to connecting with others who share similar interests and experiences so feel free to reach out.
