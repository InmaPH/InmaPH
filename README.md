## Hello World, I am Inma! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss Power BI, data gathering methods, or best practices for qualitative and quantitative analysis.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on my portfolio, so youâ€™ll notice new projects being added here regularly.

ðŸ’¡ A bit about me: I have a background in Criminology and experience as a Project Manager in Cybersecurity. Data is my true passion, and my goal is to become a SME in Microsoft Power Platforms. Iâ€™m always open to connecting with others who share similar interests and experiences!
